**Chen Sun**<br>
Brown University and Google<br>
[chen_sun4@brown.edu](mailto:chen_sun4@brown.edu)<br>
Chen Sun is an assistant professor of computer science at Brown University, and a staff research scientist at Google. His research interest is on computer vision and machine learning, with recent focus on learning multimodal temporal representations from unlabeled videos. His long-term research goal is to make video an indispensable learning source for visual perception, language understanding, robotics and cognitive science, and ultimately to develop autonomous machines that interact with and assist us in unconstrained environments. Chen finished his PhD at University of Southern California in 2016, and undergraduate study at Tsinghua University in 2011.

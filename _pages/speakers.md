Luc Van Gool is a full professor for Computer Vision at the ETH in Zurich and the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium. He leads research and teaches at both places. He coorganized the famous PASCAL VOC series of competitions, which greatly advanced the development of computer vision in image recognition, object detection, and image segmentation. His main interests include 3D reconstruction and modeling, object recognition, and tracking and gesture analysis. He has authored over 300 papers. Luc Van Gool has been a program committee member of several, major computer vision conferences (e.g. Program Chair ICCV'05, Beijing, and General Chair of ICCV'11, Barcelona, and of ECCV'14, Zurich). He received several Best Paper awards (eg. David Marr Prize '98, Best Paper CVPR'07, Tsuji Outstanding Paper Award ACCV'09, Best Vision Paper ICRA'09, Koenderink Award ECCV’16). In 2017, he was granted the `Distinguished Researcher’ status by the IEEE Society on Computer Vision.
